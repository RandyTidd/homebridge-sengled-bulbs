# homebridge-sengled-bulbs (Beta)

An unoffical [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) platform plugin for Sengled accessories.

This plugin uses the existing Sengled Element Home app infrastructure to allow you to control your Sengled accessories that uses zigbee.

Provide your username and password and register as a platform, and it will auto-detect the light bulb you have registered.

Note that I only have **Element Classic A19 Kit (Light bulbs + Hub)** to test
